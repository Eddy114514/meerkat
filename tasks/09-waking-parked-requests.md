# 09 — Wake requests parked on locks that a failure released

**Depends on:** 08 (the commit de-duplication below builds on
`ParticipantCommit`).
**Reference:** `cli-test-fixes` — `Manager::freed_awaiting_wake` (~line 163),
`take_freed_awaiting_wake` (~line 215), `release_locks` (~line 2466), and in
`meerkat/src/main.rs`: `run_and_reply_or_park` (~line 317), `dispatch_parked`
(~line 332), `wake_ready` (~line 476).

## Rationale

When a transaction fails terminally it releases its locks. But the failure
surfaces as an `EvalError`, propagating through call paths that have **nowhere
to return a set of freed keys** — and one of them, `handle_lock_request` under
`dispatch_network_events`, has no dispatcher to hand them to at all.

So the locks were freed and nobody was told. Any request parked on one of those
keys waited for the remaining life of the process on a lock nobody held.

This was got wrong independently in at least five places: originator retry,
originator completion, participant discard, `handle_lock_request` releasing
partial locks, and service initialisation. Fixing them one at a time does not
work — the next path added gets it wrong too.

Task 12 makes transactional reads routine and therefore makes parks routine,
which is why this hardening lands first.

## Specification

### 1. Record at the single choke point

Add to `Manager`:

```rust
/// Locks a transaction released, on which a request is parked waiting to be
/// woken.
freed_awaiting_wake: HashSet<WaitKey>,
```

Fill it inside `release_locks` — the one function every release already passes
through — after the locks are actually dropped:

```rust
let waited_on: Vec<WaitKey> = locked
    .iter()
    .filter(|k| self.wait_queue.get(k).is_some_and(|w| !w.is_empty()))
    .cloned()
    .collect();
self.freed_awaiting_wake.extend(waited_on);
```

**Only keys with an actual waiter are recorded.** This is what keeps the set
bounded on a node that has no loop to drain it: a CLI client parks nothing, so
it queues nothing, even though it can reach the discard path.

Drain with:

```rust
/// Take the locks released by failed transactions since the last call, to wake
/// whatever is parked on them. Empty on a quiet loop iteration.
pub fn take_freed_awaiting_wake(&mut self) -> HashSet<WaitKey>;
```

### 2. Drain it in the server loop

In `meerkat/src/main.rs`, split the existing dispatch so that every parked run
is followed by a drain:

```rust
async fn run_and_reply_or_park(manager: &mut Manager, parked: ParkedRequest) {
    dispatch_parked(manager, parked).await;
    let freed = manager.take_freed_awaiting_wake();
    if !freed.is_empty() {
        Box::pin(wake_ready(manager, freed)).await;
    }
}

async fn wake_ready(manager: &mut Manager, freed: HashSet<WaitKey>) {
    for parked in manager.take_ready_waiters(&freed) {
        run_and_reply_or_park(manager, parked).await;
    }
}
```

`dispatch_parked` holds the existing per-variant logic (run the action / lookup,
send the reply, or re-park on `EvalError::WaitOn(key)`). The `Box::pin` is
required: `run_and_reply_or_park` and `wake_ready` are mutually recursive
`async fn`s. Waiters are drained **oldest first**.

**The drain must also cover releases that happen with no dispatcher present.**
`Manager::send_and_await_reply` pumps `dispatch_network_events` while this node
waits on an outbound reply, and that pump can serve an inbound `LockRequest`
inline; `handle_lock_request` may release partial locks there. Nothing on that
path can hand the freed keys anywhere — it is running underneath an unrelated
outbound call.

Note that the server loop itself never calls `dispatch_network_events`; it
handles inbound events directly, and the pump lives only inside
`send_and_await_reply` (`manager/mod.rs:1211` and `:1252`). So there is no
"after the dispatch call" hook to attach to in `main.rs`.

Instead, **sweep at the top of every server-loop iteration**, before any other
work:

```rust
loop {
    let freed = manager.take_freed_awaiting_wake();
    if !freed.is_empty() {
        wake_ready(&mut manager, freed).await;
    }
    // ... pending updates, then the inbound-event match
}
```

This catches anything released underneath an outbound call on the previous
iteration, and it is one site rather than a list of call sites that must be
kept in sync.

### 3. Do not wake a key twice

Two paths already hand freed keys back to their caller, and once
`release_locks` queues them as well, each key is delivered twice. The failure
is not a lost wake but a spurious one: the second wake reaches the *next*
waiter while the first one still holds the lock it was just given, and wait-die
kills it.

`commit_participant` returns its keys in `ParticipantCommit::freed` (task 08)
and the caller wakes them directly. `abort_participant` returns
`HashSet<WaitKey>` (`manager/mod.rs:2141`, via
`discard_failed_participant_txn`) and on `main` the server loop passes that
straight to `wake_ready` too.

Give each key exactly one owner, resolving the two paths differently because
they sit differently:

- **Abort: use the queue.** Discard `abort_participant`'s return value and wake
  from `take_freed_awaiting_wake()` instead. The abort arm has no reason to
  care which keys came from where, and §2's loop-head sweep would catch them
  on the next iteration regardless.
- **Commit: use the return value.** `commit_participant` has to report its
  freed keys upward anyway, and its caller wakes them on the spot, so suppress
  the queueing for those keys at the commit site.

## Tests

**Illustrating test:** `test_freed_keys_are_queued_only_when_something_is_parked_on_them`
(unit test in `manager/mod.rs`). Releasing a lock with an empty wait queue must
queue nothing; releasing one with a waiter must queue exactly that key. This
pins the boundedness property, which is the part most likely to be "simplified"
away.

Also:
- `test_commit_does_not_queue_the_keys_it_hands_back` — the de-duplication in §3.
- `test_originator_reports_locks_released_on_success` and
  `test_originator_reports_locks_released_when_it_gives_up`.
- In `meerkat/src/main.rs`: `test_terminal_participant_action_wakes_parked_requests`
  and `test_terminal_participant_lookup_wakes_parked_requests` — the two
  end-to-end paths through the server loop.

## Notes

- Resist the temptation to have each failure site return its own key set. That
  is the design that failed five times. The value here is that the recording
  point is unavoidable.
